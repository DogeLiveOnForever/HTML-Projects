		<p>Unlike other rodents, guinea pigs make great pets for younger children. Why? You may ask.</p>
		<p>Hamsters, gerbals, etc. are very squirmy and bite (or at least a lot more that guinea pigs), also more hard</p>
		<p>to take care of. Guinea pigs are gental and calm. Thy are also very easy to take care of.</p>
