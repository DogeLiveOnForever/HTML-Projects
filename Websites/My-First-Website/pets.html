		<h3>Personal Experiences</h3>

		<p>I have already experienced many actions from my guinea pigs; I will highlight the top 3. When I put them back in the cage, they always try to jump in, which can hurt their back, so I put them in "back first". This prevented them from jumping in anymore, so it stuck. If you hold them for more than 15 minutes, they most likey will poop or urinate on you, so always have a towel on your lap. (They most likey will stop when they get older, but it's still a possibility). When getting my guinea pigs out of the cage, they like to sometimes run around and go inside each other's house, so I use the cage to my advantage and take out the houses, put them on the top of the cage, and reach in and scoop them up from a corner, which also calms them down for a reason I don't fully understand.</p>

		<h3>Recommendations</h3>
		<img src="/images/IMAG0236.jpg" alt="guinea pig" style="width:400px; height:250px;"/>
		<p>I may have gone over this in a previous page, but here are some recommendations on what to get for your guinea pig. One is to get the best quality and fresh hay that you can, so your guinea pig is happy. Try to get the biggest cage (that seems reasonable for your house) as you can, so they can have more space to run around freely. Use glass water bottles, as they are much safer for the guinea pig and more enviromental happy. Use edible houses (made of honey and other natural ingredients) and a hay rack to keep them well intertained, as well as some chew toys that are suited for guinea pigs. (Maybe add a carrot or two with some spinach and kale.)
