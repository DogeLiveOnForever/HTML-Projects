		<h3>The Steps On How To Handle Guinea Pigs</h3>

		<p>1.) In order to handle a guinea pig, you have to first let him/her get use to you first, if you just bought them from the pet store.</p>
		<p>2.) Put a towel on your lap, in case he/she decides it's a good time to pee or poop on you. (Trust me, it has happened many times...)
		<p>3.) Next, you want to reach for him/her and slide on hand under the guinea pig and and the other around. Make sure your being gentle, but at the same time, firm.</p>
		<p>4.) Make sure you are calm, or they will start to try to get away from you. Pet them gently so you don't hurt them!
		<p>5.) Finally, when putting your guinea pig back in the cage, put them "back first", so they don't try to hop out of your hand and land in the cage, hurting their back.</p>

		<p>Though guinea pigs seem like quiet creatures, they use noises quite often to express themselves. Understanding these is the key to understanding your critter companion.</p>
