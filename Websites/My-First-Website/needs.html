<p>Guinea pigs must have the right things to live happy and healthy. I will talk about what I use for my guinea pigs (recommended), but you don't have to use them.</p>

<h3>Food, House, Bedding</h3>
<p>Here is a table of some simple things for your guinea pig's cage. Images are what I use in my guinea pig cage.</p>

<table>
<tr>
		<th>Item</th>
		<th>Description</th>
		<th>Image</th>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>Hay</td>
		<td>The image of the hay I have on the right of this is one of the best types of hay you can get for your guinea pig. This is really the only thing I like that "Kaytee" has that is good quality.</td>
	 	<td><img src="C:\Users\max\Desktop\HTML-Projects\Websites\My-First-Website\images\IMAG0230.jpg" alt="guinea pig" style="width:125px; height:200px;"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>Feeder</td>
		<td>Try to get a feeder with a hay rack and a pellet bowl.</td>
		<td><img src="C:\Users\max\Desktop\HTML-Projects\Websites\My-First-Website\images\IMAG0233.jpg" alt="guinea pig" style="width:125px; height:200px;"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>Water Bottle</td>
		<td>Use a glass water bottle and attach it from the outside of the cage; It's more clean, enviromental happy, and healthy.</td>
		<td><img src="C:\Users\max\Desktop\HTML-Projects\Websites\My-First-Website\images\IMAG0232.jpg" alt="guinea pig" style="width:125px; height:200px;"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>House</td>
		<td>Use non-plastic house. Wood or edible homes or great for them, they can chew and have fun from it.</td>
		<td><img src="C:\Users\max\Desktop\HTML-Projects\Websites\My-First-Website\images\IMAG0234.jpg" alt="guinea pig" style="width:200px; height:125px;"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td>Bedding</td>
		<td>Try to stick with Aspen Bedding, because it's a lot more health for the guinea pigs that any other wood. Also try to get "medium" or "medium small" pieces, so it's more soft and can absorb more of the scent and urine.</td>
		<td><img src="C:\Users\max\Desktop\HTML-Projects\Websites\My-First-Website\images\IMAG0231.jpg" alt="guinea pig" style="width:125px; height:200px;"/></td>

<h3>Bonus Material:</h3>
<p>Guinea Pigs have a very sensitive respiratory system, so make sure you stay away from the paper bedding. Guinea pigs should not be fed seeds or lettuce as it is hard to digest. Guinea pigs have very fragile backs, unlike hamsters, gerbals, etc.</p>
<p>Here is also a video for more help on how to care for your guinea pigs and their needs:</p>
